	Soft-copy Submission (upload as archived directory):

		1) Typed PDF report (with all other info + annotations)
		
		2) All generated images in the report (unannotated)
		
		3) All programs that I wrote (C files)


	Report (must be a pdf):

		1) ** FINISHED ** Generate flow charts for:
			- program-1
			- program-2
			- program-3

		2) ** FINISHED ** Generate test case images and standalone captions

		3) ** FINISHED ** Paste in the code I wrote

		4) ** FINISHED ** Comment on the colour of program-3 when converting to pgm with red, green, and blue.

		5) Explain what is happening in the 4x120 an 120x4 test cases
